This repository is for a new project I'm working on for a therapist who does [Neurofeedback in CT](http://litchfieldneurofeedback.com/). Neurofeedback therapy is a form of "brain training" where patients are connected with electrodes to an eeg machine and perform exercises that allow them to retrain their own brainwaves. With consistent neurofeedback therapy sessions, over time you can improve your brain's ability to self-regulate and improve. It is very fascinating 

Neurofeedback therapy is a fascinating field and I am excited to be working with Litchfield Neurofeedback, a great company out of Litchfield, CT. I was hired by them to build a new website and do their online marketing. I've never worked with neurofeedback training before but I'm trying to learn as much as I can about neurofeedback applications, exactly how it works and how it can treat conditinos such as ADHD, trauma, anxiety, PTSD and mood disorders. 

The purpose of Litchfield Neurofeedback's new website is to educate people on the powerful benefits of neurofeedback therapy and persaude them to give it a try. Neurofeedback therapy has been proven to be an effective treatment for a myriad of conditions among children, teens and adults. Patients have experienced major improvements even after one session! But the folks over at Litchfield Neurofeedback recommend committing to a long-term plan to see real, long-lasting improvements. 

## Neurofeedback Therapy CT – Rewiring your brain with Neurofeedback

The beauty of Neurofeedback therapy, and one of the reasons I wanted to get involved in this project is the fact that your brain already has the ability to heal itself. It just takes training, just as if you were looking to gain muscle by training at the gym 5 days a week. So the goal with this project is to build a website that is intuitive, user-friendly and educational. I'm also trying to bring the right sort of clients to the site by ranking for phrases such as [Neurofeedback For Anxiety](http://litchfieldneurofeedback.com/neurofeedback-anxiety-healthy-solution-works/) and Neurofeedback therapy for ADHD. People with these sort of conditions can greatly benefit from this form of therapy or training. 

I'm so excited to be working on this project and have the opportunity to learn about neurofeedback therapy on such a high level as well as help Litchfield Neurofeedback grow!
